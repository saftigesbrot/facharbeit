This project is the practical part of a compulsory geography assignment. It shows the weaknesses of static weather forecasting algorithms, specifically hurricanes in America. 
To show the weaknesses, the programmes generate a lot of random weather data according to a specific principle and rules and try to predict them. Finally, the results are compared iwth forecast. 
Based on this comparison and the data generated, it's possible to show the weaknesses of static weather prediction algoriythms.

This project is not fully commented.
